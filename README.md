# Token Classifier 

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Graphviz package for visualizing the DFA

## About
This project involves creating a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) to classify tokens based on input text from `example.txt`. The program reads the input file, generates a DFA, and outputs the classification of tokens based on the DFA's rules.
